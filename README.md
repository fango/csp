# CSP/Transducer Experiments

Bit of messing around. WIP.

Prior work:

- CSP â€” [Introduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) and [paper](https://assets.cs.ncl.ac.uk/seminars/224.pdf)
- Channels in [core.async](http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html)
- Transducers from [Clojure](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)
- [David Nolen](https://github.com/swannodette)'s [core.async webinar](http://go.cognitect.com/core_async)

Code that does stuff is in `app.js`, the CSP stuff is in `channel.js` and there's a library of functions in `lib.js`.

## TODO

- [ ] `close`
- [ ] `alts`
