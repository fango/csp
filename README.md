# CSP/Actor/Transducer Experiments

Bit of messing around. WIP.

Prior work:

- CSP â€” [Introduction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes) and [paper](https://assets.cs.ncl.ac.uk/seminars/224.pdf)
- Channels in [core.async](http://clojure.com/blog/2013/06/28/clojure-core-async-channels.html)
- Transducers from [Clojure](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)

Code that does stuff is in `app.js`, and the CSP/Actor stuff is in `actor.js`, there's a library of functions in `lib.js`.
